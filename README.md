*How to Edit Diagrams:*

All diagrams are `.excalidraw.png` files. To edit:
1. Download the PNG
2. Open [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com)
3. Use "Open" to import and edit
4. Save and commit the updated PNG

*Entity Relationship Diagrams:*

Excalidraw supports entity relationships through Mermaid diagrams. Example with foreign key:

```mermaid
erDiagram
  USER {
    int user_id PK
    string username
    string email
    datetime created_at
  }
  POST {
    int post_id PK
    int user_id FK
    string title
    string body
    datetime created_at
  }
  USER ||--o{ POST : creates
```

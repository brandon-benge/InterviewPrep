*How to Edit Diagrams:*

Diagrams in this repository use two formats:
- **Excalidraw**: `.excalidraw.png` files - Download the PNG, open in [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com), edit, and commit
- **Mermaid**: Code-based diagrams in `.md` files - Edit the Mermaid code directly in the markdown files

*Entity Relationship Diagrams:*

Excalidraw supports entity relationships through Mermaid diagrams. Example with foreign key:

```mermaid
erDiagram
  USER {
    int user_id PK
    string username
    string email
    datetime created_at
  }
  POST {
    int post_id PK
    int user_id FK
    string title
    string body
    datetime created_at
  }
  USER ||--o{ POST : creates
```

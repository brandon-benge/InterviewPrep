## Interview Best Practices

### Problem-Solving Framework
1. **Clarify Requirements**
   - Ask clarifying questions about inputs, outputs, and constraints
   - Confirm edge cases and assumptions
   - Understand the expected time/space complexity

2. **Plan Your Approach**
   - Think out loud and explain your strategy
   - Start with a brute force solution, then optimize
   - Discuss trade-offs between different approaches

3. **Write Clean Code**
   - Use meaningful variable names
   - Structure your code logically with helper functions
   - Handle edge cases explicitly

4. **Test Your Solution**
   - Walk through your code with the given example
   - Test edge cases (empty input, single element, etc.)
   - Consider time and space complexity

### Communication Tips
- **Verbalize your thought process** throughout the interview
- **Ask questions** when requirements are unclear
- **Explain trade-offs** when choosing between approaches
- **Stay calm** if you get stuck; think out loud and work through it step by step
- **Be honest** about areas where you're uncertain

### Common Patterns to Master
- **Two Pointers:** For sorted arrays, palindromes, or finding pairs
- **Sliding Window:** For substring problems or array subarrays
- **Hash Maps:** For fast lookups and counting
- **DFS/BFS:** For tree and graph traversal
- **Dynamic Programming:** For optimization problems with overlapping subproblems
- **Binary Search:** For sorted data or optimization problems

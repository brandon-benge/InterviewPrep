# 🔔 Notification System Design

## 🧠 Overview

This document outlines the architecture and data flow of the Notification System. The system delivers personalized notifications to users through various channels (Push, In-App, Email, SMS) with support for preference management, retry handling, and delivery analytics.

## 🔄 Key Components and Flow

1. **API Gateway**
   - Receives notification requests, provides security, rate limiting, and routing.
2. **Distribution Logic**
   - Validates payloads, enriches messages, and routes based on user preferences.
3. **Channel Preference Data**
   - Stores user delivery settings and opt-in preferences.
4. **Queueing System with DLQ**
   - Handles message buffering, retry, and dead-lettering (Kafka, RabbitMQ, AWS SQS).
5. **Router**
   - Routes messages to the correct delivery channel.
6. **Channels**
   - Sends notifications via Push (APNs/FCM), In-App, Email, or SMS.
7. **Analytics System**
   - Monitors system performance and tracks user engagement.

## 🗂️ Data Flow

- Requests are received and validated.
- User preferences are checked and messages are enriched.
- Messages are queued and routed to the appropriate channel.
- Delivery and engagement metrics are tracked for analytics.

⸻

## 📊 Key Metrics

- Total notifications processed (by type)
- Success/failure rates
- Retry counts, DLQ volume
- Delivery time per channel
- Open/click-through rates
- Failure reasons and error logs
- Processing latency at each layer

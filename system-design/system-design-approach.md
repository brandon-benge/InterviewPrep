## ðŸ“‹ Step-by-Step Approach to Solve Multiple Design Problems

This systematic methodology offers a comprehensive framework for approaching any system design interview. Each phase builds upon previous work, ensuring thorough coverage while showcasing structured analytical thinking to interviewers.

### **Step 1: Requirements Clarification**
Begin by thoroughly understanding the problem scope and objectives. System design problems are typically open-ended with multiple valid solutions, making early clarification essential for interview success. Focus on defining clear goals and boundaries within the available timeframe.

**Distinguish Between Functional and Non-Functional Requirements:**
- **Functional Requirements:** Define *what* the system should do - the specific features, capabilities, and behaviors that users can directly interact with or observe. These are the core business logic and user-facing features.
  - Examples: User registration, posting content, searching data, sending notifications, processing payments
- **Non-Functional Requirements:** Define *how well* the system should perform - the quality attributes, constraints, and operational characteristics that affect user experience but aren't direct features.
  - Examples: Performance (latency, throughput), scalability, availability, security, consistency, maintainability

**Key Areas to Clarify:**
- Core user workflows and feature scope
- Expected system scale and performance targets
- Data consistency and availability requirements
- Security and compliance constraints
- Integration and platform requirements

**Requirement Prioritization Strategy:**
Always prioritize both functional and non-functional requirements early in the discussion. **This establishes a clear contract between you and the interviewer** about what will be designed and what success looks like:
- **Functional Priorities:** Identify must-have features vs. nice-to-have features for MVP and future iterations
- **Non-Functional Priorities:** Determine critical quality attributes (e.g., is 99.9% availability more important than sub-100ms latency?)
- **Business Impact Assessment:** Understand which requirements directly affect user experience and business success
- **Resource Constraints:** Consider time, budget, and team expertise when ranking requirements
- **Risk Evaluation:** Prioritize requirements that mitigate the highest business and technical risks

**Interview Contract Establishment:**
Use this phase to create mutual understanding and agreement with your interviewer on:
- **Scope boundaries:** What features and components will be included vs. excluded
- **Success criteria:** How the system's effectiveness will be measured
- **Design constraints:** Technical, business, and resource limitations that guide decisions
- **Assumption validation:** Confirm any assumptions about user behavior, traffic patterns, or infrastructure

### **Step 2: Capacity Planning and Scale Estimation**
Calculate the expected system scale including user traffic, data storage requirements, and network bandwidth needs. These estimations inform subsequent architectural decisions around scaling strategies, data partitioning, and infrastructure planning.

### **Step 3: API and Interface Design**
Specify the expected system interfaces and contracts. This establishes clear boundaries and validates requirement understanding. Consider modern API design principles including RESTful patterns, pagination strategies, versioning approaches, and rate limiting mechanisms.

### **Step 4: Data Architecture and Modeling**
Define the system's data entities, their interconnections, and information flow patterns. Address database technology selection (relational vs non-relational), storage infrastructure, and data lifecycle management considerations.

### **Step 5: System Architecture Overview**
Create a high-level architectural diagram showing 5-6 primary system components. Include essential elements like traffic distribution, application logic, data persistence, content storage, performance optimization layers, and specialized services.

### **Step 6: Deep Dive Design Analysis**
Examine 2-3 critical components in detail based on interviewer guidance. Compare alternative approaches with their respective advantages and limitations. Address data distribution strategies, performance optimization techniques, and edge case handling.

### **Step 7: Risk Assessment and Mitigation**
Identify potential system vulnerabilities and propose mitigation strategies. Evaluate failure scenarios, redundancy requirements, operational monitoring needs, and performance optimization opportunities.

### ðŸ”„ **Interview Balance Check**
Throughout the interview, regularly ensure you're maintaining balance:
- âœ… Have I covered the core user flows? (Functional)
- âœ… Have I addressed scalability and performance? (Non-functional)  
- âœ… Have I considered failure scenarios? (Non-functional)
- âœ… Have I thought about the operational aspects? (Non-functional)
- âœ… Have I discussed trade-offs for major decisions?
- âœ… Have I referenced real-world examples or past experience?

# Scenario: Rebuild Facebook with Limited CPU/Storage

_Describe your approach, trade-offs, and design decisions for rebuilding Facebook under severe resource constraints._

**Purpose:** Test prioritization, constraints, and efficiency.

## Summary
> Identify core engagement flows (e.g., posting text). Use offline batch processing for feeds. Cache content aggressively. Disable media uploads and real-time notifications.


## Feature Prioritization
- Only implement critical flows: user registration, text posts, basic feed
- Exclude media sharing, stories, live video, and search


## Storage Constraints
- Use compression and columnar storage
- Apply TTL (time-to-live) for old content
- Use sparse indices and flat key-value storage


## CPU Constraints
- Avoid synchronous processing; batch and schedule background jobs
- Use precomputed feeds and summaries


## Ranking & Feed
- Use simplified heuristic ranking instead of ML models
- Limit interactions to top N users


## Monitoring & Logging
- Minimal or disabled logging to save storage


## Metrics for Success
- Track user engagement on core features
- Monitor system resource usage (CPU, storage, network)
- Measure latency and error rates for critical flows

# Scenario: Replicate Data Across Regions

_Describe your approach to cross-region data replication, consistency, and failover._

## üéØ Purpose
- Tests your understanding of distributed systems and data consistency
- Evaluates your ability to balance latency, availability, and durability
- Assesses your approach to conflict resolution and disaster recovery
- Checks your awareness of trade-offs in global architectures

---

## üìù Summary
Choose async replication for low-latency writes. Use quorum-based reads for stronger consistency. Resolve conflicts using timestamps or version vectors.

---

## üåç Replication Strategies
- **Asynchronous Replication:**
  - Primary region handles writes, replicates changes to secondary regions in the background
  - Pros: Low write latency, high availability
  - Cons: Risk of data loss on failover, eventual consistency
- **Synchronous Replication:**
  - Writes are committed only after all (or a quorum of) regions acknowledge
  - Pros: Stronger consistency, no data loss on failover
  - Cons: Higher write latency, lower availability during network partitions
- **Hybrid/Quorum-Based:**
  - Use a quorum of regions for reads/writes (e.g., majority must agree)
  - Balances consistency and availability

---

## üîÑ Consistency Models
- **Eventual Consistency:** All regions will converge to the same state, but reads may be stale
- **Strong Consistency:** Reads always return the latest committed write (requires synchronous/quorum replication)
- **Tunable Consistency:** Allow clients to choose consistency level per operation (e.g., Cassandra, DynamoDB)

---

## üß© CAP Theorem
The CAP theorem states that in a distributed data system, you can only guarantee two out of the following three properties in the presence of a network partition:
- **Consistency (C):** Every read receives the most recent write or an error.
- **Availability (A):** Every request receives a (non-error) response, regardless of the state of other nodes.
- **Partition Tolerance (P):** The system continues to operate despite network partitions (communication breakdowns between nodes/regions).

**Key clarification:**
- When there is no network partition, a system can provide both Consistency and Availability.
- When a partition occurs (which is inevitable in distributed, cross-region systems), the system must choose to either:
  - Remain **consistent** (some requests may be denied to prevent stale reads), or
  - Remain **available** (all requests are served, but some may return stale data).

**In cross-region replication:**
- Partition tolerance is required due to the nature of wide-area networks.
- The trade-off between Consistency and Availability only arises during a partition event.

## üßÆ PACELC Theorem
PACELC extends CAP by considering system behavior not only during partitions, but also under normal operation:
- **If there is a Partition (P):** choose between Availability (A) and Consistency (C) ‚Äî just like CAP.
- **Else (E), when the system is running normally:** choose between Latency (L) and Consistency (C).

**In practice:**
- Systems like DynamoDB, Cassandra, and Cosmos DB allow tuning this trade-off.
- You may choose lower latency (faster responses) at the cost of weaker consistency, or stronger consistency with higher latency, even when there is no partition.

**Summary Table:**
| Theorem | Partition? | Trade-off |
|---------|------------|-----------|
| CAP     | Yes        | C vs. A   |
| PACELC  | Yes        | C vs. A   |
| PACELC  | No         | C vs. L   |

## ‚öîÔ∏è Conflict Resolution
- **Last Write Wins (timestamp-based):** Simple, but may lose updates
- **Version Vectors:** Track causality and resolve conflicts more accurately
- **Custom Merge Logic:** For complex data types (e.g., CRDTs)

---

## üö® Failover & Disaster Recovery
- **Automated Failover:** Detect region failure and promote a new primary
- **Data Reconciliation:** Sync missed updates after recovery
- **Backup & Restore:** Regular cross-region backups for disaster recovery

---

## üì° Network & Latency Considerations
- Use geo-DNS or global load balancers to route users to the nearest healthy region
- Minimize cross-region traffic for latency-sensitive operations
- Compress and batch replication traffic

---

## üîí Security & Compliance
- Encrypt data in transit and at rest across all regions
- Ensure compliance with data residency and privacy laws (e.g., GDPR)

---

## üìà Metrics for Success
- Replication lag (seconds behind primary)
- Data consistency error rate
- Recovery time objective (RTO) and recovery point objective (RPO)
- User-perceived latency and availability
